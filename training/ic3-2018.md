# IC3 Ethereum/Cornell Bootcamp: Getting Started with Ethereum & Solidity

## Requirements:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
- [Metamask (do not install before the bootcamp unless you have worked with Ethereum before)](https://metamask.io/)

## What are things?

### [Ethereum](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/)
Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.

### [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
MetaMask is a bridge between Google Chrome and the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to run Ethereum Dapps in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.

### [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Solidity is a programming language used to code smart contracts that are compatible with Ethereum. [The documentation for Solidity is located here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We will be using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.13+commit.fb4cb1a.js) when developing our smart contracts. Remix is an online development environment that allows you to code, deploy, and test smart contracts on the public Ethereum networks and test Ethereum networks.

### [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)
Ropsten is a public Ethereum test network that is used to deploy and test smart contracts for free. In order to receive Ropsten ether coins, you will need to visit https://faucet.metamask.io/ once you have your Metamask client installed.

## Coding your first smart contract!

a. Setting up Metamask
  1. Install the [Metamask Chrome plugin](https://metamask.io/).
  2. Open Metamask (there should be an orange fox icon in your browser toolbar).
  3. Click through the license agreements.
  4. Create a new "den" which will house your Ethereum account.
  5. COPY THE 12 WORDS SOMEWHERE SAFE.
  6. Click the network selection button on the top left part of the Metmask app. It should say "Ethereum Mainnet". Change that to "Ropsten".
  7. Copy your Ethereum account address by clicking on the 3 big dots by "Account 1" and selecting the "Copy address to clipboard".

b. Get Ropsten Testnet Ether
  1. Visit [the Metamask Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io/).
  2. Click "request 1 ether from faucet".
  3. Click on the blue transaction hash that pops up under "transactions".
  4. Look at your Metamask client and verify that you received 1 Ropsten testnet ether.
  
c. Writing your first smart contract.
  1. Go to the [Remix website](https://remix.ethereum.org).
  2. Open another browser tab with [the sample Solidity code we will be working with](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Souptacular/souptacular.github.io/master/training/solidity/SimpleStore.sol). You can find it here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Souptacular/souptacular.github.io/master/training/solidity/SimpleStore.sol.
  3. We will walk through the rest of the steps in class.
