# Here It Is
I am an Ethereum enthusiast and core developer liason with a rich background in blockchain projects. Since first discovering Bitcoin in 2011 I have played an active role in various online communities for decentralized technology, including Ethereum and Zcash. After spending two years at USAA (2014-2016) starting their blockchain program, I left to work at the Ethereum Foundation (2016-2021). As an Ethereum community member, I co-founded the [Ethereum Cat Herders](http://ethereumcatherders.com/) (2019-present). I also co-founded Oaken Innovations (2016-2018), an IoT security start-up that utilizes distributed/decentralized software. I currently am a committee member of [Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG)](https://zcashomg.org/) (2020-present). Some things I enjoy include converting VHS tapes to digital formats, playing tabletop RPGs with friends, TV shows targeted at millennials, Overwatch, and cookies 'n cream flavored ice cream.
